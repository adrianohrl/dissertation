    \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
        This work presents the \textit{rqt\_mrta}, an ROS-based project that provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) plugin for configuring multirobot task allocation (MRTA) architectures. Moreover, it arranges graphical elements for system supervision and monitoration them during runtime. A generic approach of the ALLIANCE architecture is developed in order to test and validate this graphical tool by creating a multirobot patrol application. The results shows that the usage of the \textit{rqt\_mrta} plugin facilitates the parametrization of MRTA architectures.
