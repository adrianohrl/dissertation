        This work presents the \textit{rqt\_mrta}, an ROS-based project that provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) plugin for configuring multirobot task allocation (MRTA) architectures. Moreover, it arranges graphical elements for system supervision and monitoration during runtime. Due to the small amount of generic approaches of MRTA architectures in ROS, a domain-independent approach of the ALLIANCE architecture was developed in the the \textit{alliance} package. It was developed in order to test and validate this graphical tool. In addition, a multirobot patrol application was designed and simulated using \textit{alliance}. The \textit{alliance} parametrization and the application creation were performed through the \textit{rqt\_mrta} plugin. During its execution, the supervision graphical resources of \textit{rqt\_mrta} were analyzed. Finally, through this test application, it was verified that the complexity of MRTA architecture parametrization was reduced by using the package. Furthermore, \textit{rqt\_mrta} assisted the user by supervising the multirobot system.
